ScheduleEvent Flow
it's like a key generated between the specified interval. need to get the scheduleEvent first before compute moving average


SimpleMovingAverage run calls schedulerManager periodicCallback
=>
schedulerManager periodicCallback schedules trigger and timer job and start the job (interval used in trigger, timer job defined) 
=>
timer job periodically puts scheduleEvent to scheduleEventBroker's blocking queue
(scheduleEvent just contains a tag indicating sma1 or 2)


SimpleMovingAverage run takes out one scheduleEvent from scheduleEventBroker's blocking queue and calls handleEvent(ScheduleEvent), which passes the scheduleEvent to computeSMA 
=> 
computeSMA checks tag from scheduleEvent (sma1 or 2)
=>
computeSMA uses cachedOrderBook to update sma1 and sma1data
=>
computeSMA calls riskWatcher handleEvent to check if it needs to generate signal


schedulerManager => eventManager => orderBookBroker and scheduleEventBroker


sma1 is descriptiveStatistics with a window size of 10. Each value is a weighted average computed from an orderbook. 
sma1Data  is descriptiveStatistics with a window size of 10. Each value is the mean of sma1. the most recent value is used to compare with sma2 to generate signal to buy or sell
